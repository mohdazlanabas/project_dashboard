Ai Dashboard for an Integrated Solid Waste Management Center

THis is the prompt file that started the project

I plan to host this on GCP

Show me a simple Hello World type app touches all the components in the architecture sort of MVP I can deploy easily in an hour on GCP.

Adjust MVP on these points. Build an AI dashboard. What i would like to do is create a dashboard that can show and analyse the data in the database. 

I have two database in MongoDB. One database i have information such as Transacton_ID, Lorry Plate Number named Lorry_ID, Weight of Waste that the lorry carry passing the weighing bridge, time of day. Second databse is the Lorry_ID information sucha as Lorry_ID, Types_ID, Client_ID, lorry make Make__ID. 

Using Django + HTMX + DRF + MongoDB, TailwindCSS, Vertex AI (Gemini)

Show first the project architecture and project folder structure.

Keep in mind we sill start a small MVP, sort of a Hello World with 500 datapoints.

Dont make it yet, we will discuss the system architechture first. And go through it step by step.

Based on the project descriptio, how would you improve these architechture.

The dashboard will allow a user to see aggregated data (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) grouped by lorry type, displaying the total weight of waste delivered. For any further details, custom summaries, or complex questions, the user will interact with an AI assistant (Gemini) to get natural language answers.
